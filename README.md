# TheHumanPoseDetectionProject
Hello! This is JackyJerky. Thank you for being interested into my project!
I made a youtube video about this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tuuuo--puo

How to use?
  Go to your terminal and simply run these four programs
    1. Publisher_jumping_placeblock.py
    2. walking.py
    3. turnbody_swimming.py
    4. punching_mining.py
    
What I used:
  1. Opencv for human pose estimation, 
  2. Socket for communicating between the four programs


Note1: This is the very first project I did, and I actually did this a year ago. At that time I am still very new to computer science
so you can see that some of the code may not be very good. But overall it works

Note2: both of your arms have to be lifted up to be consider playing. If you put down both of your arms, the program wont run.
